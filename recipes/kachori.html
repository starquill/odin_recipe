    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>The kachori is believed to have originated from the Marwar region of Rajasthan, India.[9] The use of mild spices like coriander and fennel in the kachori's preparation is thought to be a reflection of the region's climatic conditions, making it well-suited for the dry and hot environment.Over time, the kachori gained popularity as a convenient travel snack, a quick and wholesome start to the day for hungry businessmen and workers alike.</p>

            <li>3/4 cup black gram (husked), soaked</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp asafoetida (hing)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix in the flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the ghee to the flour</li>
            <li>Make it into a crumbly mixture with the tips of your fingers.</li>
            <li>Add enough water, to make it into a stiffish dough (it should not yield easily when a finger is pressed into it). Cover and leave to rest for at least 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make marble-sized balls of the lentil mixture (called pithee) wetting your hands as and when necessary to prevent the mixture from sticking to them. Cover with a cloth till ready to fill.</li>
            <li>Make about 20 smooth balls from the dough. Roll them out till 1/4 " thick (about 5 cms/ 2 in diameter).</li>
            <li>Take one piece of rolled dough and pinch the edge all around, leaving the center thicker.</li>
            <li>Dampen the pressed edges, place a ball of filling in the center and bring wet edges together, covering the filling completely. Press together to seal.</li>
            <li>Place this piece in your palm and with the heal of the other palm, press gently in the center. Flatten a bit with palm first then roll it lightly in a round.</li>
            <li>The kachauris are now ready to be fried. Heat the oil in a kadahi.</li>
            <li>When a piece of dough dropped in oil comes up at once, put in as many kachauris that can fit in; turn over immediately and lower heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Fry them till they all turn an even golden in color; reducing the heat from medium to low.</li>
            <li>Takes about 10 minutes for one side and 7-8 minutes on the other. Remove from oil, drain and place on absorbent paper. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
